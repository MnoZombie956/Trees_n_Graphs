# Trees_n_Graphs
A Jupyter-python approch into a collection of concepts in data structures and algorithms(re-exercising some of what I learned while taking a course at uni) that I made during my college vacation.

*This is a personal code oriented breakthrough over tree concepts and implementation, it isn't my main theorical subjects' notes, the code is educational.
